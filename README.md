# Playwright BDD Testing with TypeScript

Here is step-by-step guide on creating Playwright tests using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Playwright

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Creating a Page Object

### Step 2: Create a Page Object

If you need to work on a new page, create a page object. If you're working with an existing page, you can skip this step.

### Example: CartPage.ts

```typescript
import { Page, Locator } from 'playwright';
import { Header } from './Header';
import { Footer } from './Footer';

export class CartPage {
    readonly page: Page;
    readonly header: Header;
    readonly cartHeading: Locator;
    readonly allProductsInCart: Locator;
    readonly footer: Footer;

    constructor(page: Page) {
        this.page = page;
        this.header = new Header(page);
        this.cartHeading = page.getByText('Your Cart');
        this.allProductsInCart = page.locator('div.cart_item');
    }
}
```

## Implementing Locators

### Step 3: Implement Locators

Inside your page object, implement locators for elements you want to interact with.

## Error Handling

### Step 4: Create Methods with Error Handling

Implement methods in your page object, using try-catch blocks for error handling.

#### Example: doLogin Method

```typescript
/**
 * Login with the user name and password
 * @param userName User Name
 * @param password Password
 * We suggest not to store passwords in the code
 */
public async doLogin(userName: string, password: string) {
    try {
        await this.userName.fill(userName);
        await this.password.fill(password);
        await this.loginButton.click();
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Login functionality does not work properly | Error occurred: ${error}`);
    }
}
```

## Step Definitions

### Step 5: Create Step Definitions

If you're working with an existing step file, you can skip this step. Otherwise, define the steps for your test in a new step file.

#### Example: Login Steps

```typescript


When('the User tries to login with {string} as username and {string} as password', async ({ loginPage }, username: string, password: string) => {
    await loginPage.doLogin(username, password);
});

Then('copyright text in footer should be visible', async ({ productsPage }) => {
    await expect(productsPage.footer.copyrightText).toBeVisible();
});

Then('the copyright text contents should be correct', async ({ productsPage }) => {
    const textContent = await productsPage.footer.getCopyrightTextContent();
    expect(textContent).toEqual('Â© 2024 Sauce Labs. All Rights Reserved. Terms of Service | Privacy Policy');
});
```

## Writing Feature Files

### Step 6: Create Feature Files

Create feature files using Gherkin syntax to define your test scenarios.

#### Example: login.feature

```gherkin
@valid_creds 
Scenario Outline: Login should work with valid login credentials
  Given the User is on the login page
  When the User tries to login with "<username>" as username and "<password>" as password
  Then the User should be on the Products page

  Examples: 
    | username                | password     |
    | standard_user           | secret_sauce |
    | problem_user            | secret_sauce |
    | performance_glitch_user | secret_sauce |
```

## Executing Tests

### Step 7: Execute the Tests

Run your tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run test:admin
```

This command will execute the tests using the admin storage state. Check your `playwright.config.ts` file for all configuration settings.



## Storage State Setup Process

### Step 1: 
I have created an `authSetup` file.  
Inside this file, I have set up `admin`, `CLO`, `credit`, `loanAdmin`, and `RM` setup files. After the execution of the `admin` setup file, the admin storage state is stored in a JSON file.

### Step 2: 
In the `playwright.config.ts` file, I have created dependencies for `admin`, `CLO`, `credit`, `loanAdmin`, and `RM` and shared these dependencies inside the project.  
For example, when running `admin` test cases, the `admin` dependency (`admin.setup.ts`) should run first.

### Step 3: 
Go to the `package.json` file.  
Inside the scripts, I have added custom commands for `admin` and `loan` tag, so I can run tests with the command:  

```bash
npm run test:admin
```
